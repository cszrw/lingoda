Hi 

I assumed you did not want to see an api_platform app.

I also only did minimal testing of the client as the redux-form is pretty well tested.

I was going to display a list of contact enquiries but it was not in the spec so I decided against it and deleted the actions.

I did not abstract any config. I would for a prod app.

Many thanks
